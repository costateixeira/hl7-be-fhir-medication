# Medication Classification and grouping

Classification and grouping are especially important when we have medication workflows. We need to be able to group medication from several points of view in order to facilitate visuallization, clinical practice and medication usage.

The most easy and standard classification are chemical and clinical classification. Where the products and drugs are classified and grouped regarding intrynsic properties. However, there are more subjective classificaiton like leggaly or clinically cocntroloed medication which can be substantially different from institution to institution.

Moreover, we may want to garantee flexible grouping and classification since the summary view should be possible to make aggregation on demand on several kind of properties. This will enable easier visuallization and better healthcare practices.
