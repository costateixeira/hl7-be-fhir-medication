The exchange of medication information needs to support:  


1. **Medication Record**: collection of information directly related to the patient's medication use, including
**planning and performing medication treatments** - prescriptions, dispensing, etc., and **monitoring** - allergies, adverse events, and history.

2. **Medication Treatment**: collection of all medications the patient was planned to take in the past, presently or in the future, not partitioned or grouped by pathology, planner, organization, etc.

3. **Medication Treatment Item**: represents a past, ongoing, or planned medication, including its name, dosage, frequency of intake, etc. as well as other information such as patient- and fulfilment instructions and substitution handling. A Medication Treatment Plan Item can trigger prescriptions, dispenses or medication administrations in order to fulfil the medication treatment planned.

4. **Medication Treatment Summary**: an aggregated view of one or more medication treatment lines, for example partitioned by indication, or product.
